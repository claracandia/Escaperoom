            that said that a secret agent had passed information about him and his
            family to one of the defendants in the ENLA case,' said the legislator.
            As soon as Bisman's accusation against President Christian F. Killam
            became known, she and her colleague Lauren Allen summoned him to Congress
            to expand their complaint.\u201D"
